Classic 3D game made using Unity Engine. The prototype of my game can be found in <a href="https://learn.unity.com/project/roll-a-ball">this tutorial link</a>. Besides all the classic features of Rolling a Ball, I added some additional ones such as respawning, random rotation of the cubs, score board and so on.

  The goal of this game is to collect all the <em>yellow cubes</em>. There are in total 16 of them, suspending in the air while maitainting their self-roration. The directions of their rotation are completely random for each game. They may look scary while rotating, but don't worry;) Just rock the cubs and get yourself
